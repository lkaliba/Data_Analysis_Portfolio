# 🧥 Urban Hamster Case Study: Return Policy & Order Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes customer returns and order trends for **Urban Hamster**, a fictional clothing retailer. The goal was to evaluate the performance of the company’s return policy and identify opportunities for improvement.

Using SQL, I queried a multi-year dataset to identify patterns in return behavior, assess financial impact, and compare Urban Hamster’s performance to industry benchmarks. I also created a presentation to communicate key findings and built an interactive Tableau dashboard as a visual extension of the analysis.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- **SQL (Snowflake):** Data extraction and analysis  
- **Tableau:** Dashboard creation for order insights  
- **PowerPoint:** Business presentation of findings

## 📊 Business Questions Answered
- What is Urban Hamster’s return rate, and how does it compare to the retail industry average?
- Which products are returned most often, and why?
- How has the return rate changed over time?
- What recommendations can reduce return volume while improving customer experience?

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Urban Hamster’s **2024 return rate was 10%**, outperforming the **industry average of 13.2%** by over 24%.
- **Pants, leggings, and hosiery** were the most returned categories—likely due to fit and sizing issues.
- Returns led to over **$1 million in lost revenue** over the study period.
- Return volume has **increased steadily year over year**, signaling a need for policy review.

## ✅ Recommendations
- Extend the return window to 30 days.
- Accept items in “resalable” (not just pristine) condition.
- Offer free return shipping and return drop-off barcodes.
- Digitize and simplify the return process with online request tools.

These strategies aim to improve trust, increase retention, and reduce cart abandonment.
