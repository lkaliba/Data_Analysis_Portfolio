According to Capital One Shopping's research department, the average return rate was 13.2% in 2024 for the U.S. retail industry (including online and brick-and-mortar stores) (Capital One Shopping, 2025). That means Urban Hamster's return rate is 3.2% below the industry average and 24% lower than the national average (3.2 / 13.2 = 24.2). Postively, this suggests Urban Hamster is doing well in terms of return management.

We recognize that we have a strict return policy. How might that policy be
impacting our sales, reputation, and return rate? Given those impacts, what
changes would you recommend to that policy?

When answering this question, there will NOT be one right or wrong answer. However, you should be able to justify
your reasoning and recommendations using one or more reliable sources. (Be sure to cite* your sources.) You might
also choose to reference the policies of other, similar companies. 

Answer:
While Urban Hamster has managed return rates relatively well overall (with a 2024 rate of 10.2% compared to the 13.2% U.S. retail average), its strict return policy may be quietly undermining broader business performance. Specifically, the policy could be suppressing sales as customers may be deterred from finalizing purchases due to the increased perceived risk. A short return window or restrictive conditions can reduce buyer confidence, especially for first-time shoppers who aren't sure about the product they are purchasing (Raz, 2017). It could also be hurting the company's reputation; while we would need customer review data to confirm this, it’s common for strict policies to lead to frustration, negative online feedback, and reduced customer loyalty over time (Returnalyze, 2023). The return policy could also be a contributing factor to our recent return rate increases. Though still lower than the national average, our return rate has edged up from 9.2% in 2019 to 10.2% in 2024, possibly indicating shifting customer expectations or dissatisfaction with the current process.

Recommended Policy Changes:
To improve the customer experience, preserve sales momentum, and stay competitive with industry standards, I recommend the following adjustments:

1. Extend the return window from 14 days to 30 days, giving customers more time to evaluate their purchase without pressure.

2. Relax condition requirements slightly: Instead of demanding items be unworn with tags still attached, we could allow returns for items in "good condition" or "resalable condition", which is more customer-friendly while still protecting product integrity.

3. Cover return shipping costs and simplify the process: Industry leaders like Amazon offer free returns and handle packaging at drop-off locations (Amazon.com, Inc., 2025). Adopting similar practices — such as scannable return barcodes at UPS or USPS — would reduce friction and improve trust.

4. Implement online return requests: Allowing customers to request returns through their account (instead of calling customer service) would streamline the process, reduce call volume, and align with modern online retail standards.

These updates wouldn’t just make our return process easier — they could also improve brand reputation, increase customer loyalty, and ultimately boost net sales by reducing cart abandonment and buyer hesitation. Additionally, tracking return reasons and surveying customers who abandon carts could provide valuable insight into how policy changes impact actual behavior over time.
