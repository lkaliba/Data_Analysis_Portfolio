# 🏠 Mortgage Loan Bias Analysis
**Author:** Logan Kaliba  
**Date:** June 2021  

## 📌 Project Overview
This project investigates whether African Americans are disproportionately denied mortgage loans compared to white non-Hispanic applicants. Using a cleaned dataset derived from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA), I explored approval rates across race and income level and used a **two-sample t-test** to test for significant bias.

## 🧠 Key Questions
- Are Black applicants being denied loans at a higher rate than white applicants?
- Does income class (lower, middle, upper) affect racial disparities in approval rates?
- Is the difference **statistically significant**?

## 📊 Tools & Techniques
- **Excel:** Data cleaning, VLOOKUP, pivot tables, stacked bar charts, IF/COUNT formulas  
- **Statistics:** 2-sample t-test, comparison of proportions  
- **Communication:** PowerPoint presentation summarizing key insights

## 📈 Key Finding
At a **95% confidence level**, the statistical test found **significant evidence** that African Americans were denied loans more often than their white counterparts — even after accounting for income level.
