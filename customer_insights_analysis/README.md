# Customer Insights & Marketing Strategy

**Author:** Logan Kaliba  
**Date:** Jun 2025

## Overview

This project explores customer behavior, purchasing patterns, demographic segments, and marketing opportunities for **Urban Hamster**, a fictional apparel retailer. Using SQL-based data exploration and business question analysis, I identified the company’s most valuable customer segments and developed data-driven marketing recommendations tailored to different generations.

The project concludes with a presentation synthesizing insights into a clear marketing strategy for the Consumer Insights team.

## Tools & Technologies

* **SQL:** Data exploration, segmentation analysis, KPI calculations
* **PowerPoint:** Stakeholder-ready presentation

## Business Questions Answered

(queries stored in [`data_exploratory_and_analysis.sql`](./data_exploratory_and_analysis.sql))

* How many registered users does Urban Hamster have, and where are they located?
* What demographic groups spend the most, and who places the most orders?
* What are the most popular product categories within each age–gender segment?
* Which users generate the highest total revenue?
* What percentage of registered users make purchases?
* How should Urban Hamster tailor marketing strategies by generation?

## Key Insights

* **79.9%** of registered users made at least one purchase. 
* Top-spending customer IDs: **99148, 82305, 48605**. 
* **Men spend more per order** on average than women (**$91.4 vs $81.1**). 
* **Millennial Men** and **Gen X Men** generated the highest total spend. 
* **Millennial Women** and **Gen X Women** placed the most orders. 
* Most popular category pairs:

  * *Millennial & Gen X Women:* **Intimates, Dresses**
  * *Millennial & Gen X Men:* **Jeans, Tops/Tees/Underwear** 

These insights highlight distinct behaviors between high-spending and high-volume customers—useful for personalized targeting.

## Marketing Recommendations

Grounded in behavioral data and consumer psychology:

* **Millennials:**
  Personalization, SEO, cross-device content, video marketing, authentic messaging.

* **Gen X:**
  Multichannel approach (email + Facebook + YouTube), loyalty programs, hybrid digital/traditional communication.

* **Baby Boomers:**
  Search-friendly content, simple design, benefit-focused messaging, strong customer service.

* **Gen Z:**
  TikTok & Instagram, influencer content, community-driven messaging, inclusive brand values.

These recommendations are aligned with both internal data and external consumer research.
