# RUSH: Sales Analysis

**Author:** Logan Kaliba  
**Date:** August 10, 2025

## Overview

This project analyzes multi-year sales data for **RUSH**, a fictional athletic apparel retailer. Using Python and exploratory data analysis techniques, I evaluated product performance, geographic trends, and customer purchasing patterns to identify opportunities for growth across product categories and regions.

The analysis answers key business questions around top-performing categories, state-level sales patterns, and retailer-level purchasing behavior. A presentation accompanies the notebook to communicate insights and recommendations clearly to business stakeholders.

## Tools & Technologies

* **Python:** Data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis
* **Pandas / NumPy:** Data preparation and summarization
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** Visualizing trends and comparisons
* **PowerPoint:** Business storytelling and recommendations
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Full analysis workflow

## Business Questions Answered

* Which product categories generated the highest sales?
* What states drove the strongest performance for men’s and women’s apparel?
* Which retailers purchased the most units across 2020 and 2021?
* What insights can help strengthen RUSH’s merchandising and channel strategy?

## Key Insights

* **Women’s Apparel** led 2021 category sales with **$70,472**.
* **California** generated the highest 2021 women’s product sales (**$8,540**).
* **Texas** led men’s product sales in 2021 with **$9,194** — but California closely followed with **$8,899**.
* Top retailers by units purchased:

  * **2021:** Amazon
  * **2020:** West Gear
* Strongest 2021 sales channels:

  * **Online:** $196,939
  * **Outlet:** $104,971

These findings highlight strong digital performance and emerging opportunities in region-specific men’s marketing.

## Recommendations

* **Prioritize online marketing**, as online channels lead overall revenue.
* **Strengthen outlet store strategies** through exclusive product lines.
* **Target men’s apparel marketing in California**, where sales nearly rival Texas.
* **Capitalize on women's apparel leadership** through expanded seasonal offerings.
