# Logan Kaliba - Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my data analysis portfolio! Each project below demonstrates my experience across different tools, languages, and workflows used to clean, analyze, visualize, and derive insights from data.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Logan Kaliba â€” a graduate student with a background in psychology and sociology, now pivoting into the world of data analytics. My journey began with a deep curiosity about how people think and how systems affect them. That eventually led me to data: a powerful way to understand patterns, uncover problems, and tell stories that matter. Iâ€™ve developed hands-on experience in Python, SQL, Tableau, and Excel through coursework, projects, and self-study. My focus is on **storytelling through data**, with an interest in projects that promote equity, access, and informed decision-making. I enjoy working on projects that simulate real-world problems and building dashboards and presentations that make insights easy to understand.

Iâ€™m currently looking for work opportunities where I can grow my skills, collaborate with a thoughtful team, and contribute to meaningful work. Here is a link to my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lkaliba/Data_Analysis_Portfolio/main/Kaliba_Resume.pdf).

Thanks for stopping by!
