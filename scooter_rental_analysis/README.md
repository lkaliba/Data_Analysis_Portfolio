# 🛴 Scooter Rental Data Analysis
**Author:** Logan Kaliba  
**Date:** March 6, 2025

This project explores a dataset of scooter rentals and analyzes how weather and time-related features affect ridership. It includes visualizations and a simple linear regression model to predict scooter demand (rentals_totals) during specific weather conditions (temp_norm).

## 📌 Overview
- Dataset: 731 records of daily scooter rentals
- Columns include: temperature, humidity, workday indicators, season, and rental counts
- Goal: Understand patterns and build a predictive model

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development
- **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **LinearRegression** from Scikit-Learn for modeling

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Temperature is positively correlated** with total rentals (r ≈ 0.63)
- **Winter sees the lowest rental activity**
- **Linear Regression Model** was able to predict rentals based on temperature with a reasonable R² score (0.37)

## 🤖 Model Summary
The regression equation: rentals_total = 1,327.93 + (6,463.97 * temp_norm)

The model can estimate scooter rental demand based on weather temperature.
